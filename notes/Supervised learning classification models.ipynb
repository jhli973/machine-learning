This second time the weak classifier is trained, the weights of the training set are adjusted so the examples properly classified the first time are weighted less and the examples incorrectly classified in the first iteration are weighted more.

So you should keep all of the examples from the positive class and undersample or discard examples from the negative class. One draback of this approach is deciding which negative examples to toss out. The examples you choose to toss out could carry valuable information that isn't contained in the remaining examples. One solution for this is to pick samples to discard that aren't near the decision boundary."
