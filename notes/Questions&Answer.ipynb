    "- P-values are used to determine whether a null hypothesis is to be accepted or rejected. The p-value is a probability reflects the measure of evidence against the null hypothesis. To make a decision between accepted or rejected, significant limits are specified in advance at the level of significance alpha, by default it is 0.05. If p-value is less than this limit, the result is significant and the null hypothesis should be rejected. However, p-value alone does not permit any direct statement about the direction. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Confidence interval is a range of values calculated by statistical methods with a probability defined (usually is 95%). This means that the confidence interval covers the true value in 95 out 100 studies performed. The advantage of confidence limits in comparision with p-value is that they reflect the results at the level of data measurement. Confidence interals indicate the direction of the effect studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a confidence intervals is given, several conclusions can be made. First, values below the lower limit or above the upper limit are not excluded but are unlikely. With the confidence limit of 95%, each of these probabilities is only 2.5%. Velues within the confidence limits but near to the limits are mostly less probabble than values near the point estimate\n",

    "For example, an experiment to test if two drugs have different effects on blood pressure. The null hypothesis might be \"there is no difference between the two drug with respect to their effect on the blood pressure. The alternative hypothesis can either be formulated as a two-tailed hypothesis (any difference) or a one-tailed hypothesis (positive or negative effect). check [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689604/)"

    "A Student’s t-test will tell you if there is a significant variation between groups. A t-test compares means, while the ANOVA compares variances between populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could technically perform a series of t-tests on your data. However, as the groups grow in number, you may end up with a lot of pair comparisons that you need to run. ANOVA will give you a single number (the f-statistic) and one p-value to help you support or reject the null hypothesis.\n",

    "One-way or two-way refers to the number of independent variables (IVs) in your Analysis of Variance test. One-way has one independent variable (with 2 levels) and two-way has two independent variables (can have multiple levels)."
