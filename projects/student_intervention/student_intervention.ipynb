In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: Effective in high dimensional spaces, Robust to noise or outliers, Offer best classification performance on the training data, Make good decisions for data points that are outside the training set\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, the methods might perform poorly, Sensitive to tuning parameters and kernel choice, hard to run and tune\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: commonly used for stock market forecasting, text and hypertext categorization, classification of images, and recognization of hand-written characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational for using in this sproblem: Support vector machine offers best classification and does not overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decision tree classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: Simple to understand and to interpret. Requires little data preparation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems. Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree. Decision tree can cause overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Used by banks to classify loan applicants by the probability of defaulting payment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational for using in this sproblem: This method has been used for classifing loan applicants by the probability of defaulting payment which is similar to this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LogisticRegression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: A pretty well-behaved classification algorithm that can be trained as long as you expected your features to be roughly linear and the problem to be linearly separable. You can do some feature engineering to turn most non-linear features into linear pretty easily. Robut to noise and you can avoid overfitting and even do feature selection by using l2 or l1 regularization. Computationally inexpensive, easy update your model, pretty efficient and can be used for large dataset. Output can be interpreted as a proability. Lots of ways to regularize your model and you don't have to worry about your features being correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: It can hardly handle categorical (binary) features. Prone to underfitting, may have low accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Commonly used for binary classification. for example, a student is either academically successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational for using in this sproblem: this method has beens used for prediction similar binary classification problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ensemble methods (option)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two families of ensemble methods: \n",
    "**1. Average methods:** for example Bagging, build several estimators independently and then average their predictions.\n",
    "**2. Boosting methods:** for example Adaboost, base estimators are built sequentially and thus reduce the biases of the combined estimator\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: In general, ensemble methods offer good accuracy and overfitting is not an issue. Adaboosting is capable reducing both bias and variance, has good generalisation properties, output converges to the logarithm of likelihood ratio. In low noise cases, AdaBoost gives good performance because it is able to optimize the ensemble without overfitting. Bagging and Randomization do well in both the noisy and noise free cases because they are focusing on the statistical problem and noise increases this statistical problem. In very large datasets, Random forest can be expected to do better than Bagging because bootstrap replicates of a large training set are very similar to the training set itself and hence the learned decision tree will not be very diverse. Random forest creates diversity under all conditions but at the risk of generating low quality decision trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weakness: In high noise cases, AdaBoost puts a large amount of weight on the mislabeled examples and this leads it to overfit very badly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Although ensemble methods can help you win machine learning competitions by devising sophisticated algorithms and producing results with high accuracy, it is often not preferred in the industries where interpretability is more important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rational for using in this sproblem: I would not use these methods because ensemble methods are not preferred in the industries."

    "I would first exclude the model derived from decision tree(DT). First, model derived from DT has big difference between train and test F1 score, suggesting potential overfitting problem. Second, increasing the train size usually should increase the accuracy (here is the F1 score), however the F1 score was reduced when the training set size increased to 300. The model derived from support vector machine (SVM) also has a similar problem as saw in decision tree model. Increasing the train size was not helpful for improvement of the accuracy for both train and test F1 score. In contrast, Increasing the train size was consistently beneficial of train and test F1 score for model derived from Logistic Regression (LR). Model derived from SVM is hard to understand and interpret, while model derived from LR can be interpreted as a probability. Out of three models, the one derived from LR show the highest F1 score. Based on these facts, I would select the model derived from LR as the best model for further optimization. "

    "Because it is a binary classification, we have choosen the Logistic Regression classification algorithm. This model is robut to noise and computatuionlly inexpensive. So model can be easily update. Since this model works efficiently, it is suitable for large dataset. Output can be converted as a probability and therefore can be easily interpreted. However, this algorithm prones to underfit which seems not a problem in our initial screening. "
